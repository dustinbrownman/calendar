# Calendar

This is a simple calendar built as an exercise for [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). My goal
is to gain more experience working with Ruby's object-oriented design and trying
out Active Record for the first time.

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to
create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

The app is built in pure Ruby. The user interface is simple command line and models are still
developing. Please keep this in mind as you check it out.

To start the app, run `ruby calendar.rb`.

Enjoy!
