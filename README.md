# Calendar

This is a simple calendar built as an exercise for
[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/).

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to
create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

The app is in super early development. The user interface is simple command line and models are still developing. Please keep this in mind as you check it out.

To start the app, run `ruby calendar.rb`.

Enjoy!
